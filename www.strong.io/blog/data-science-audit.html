                            Tracking pageviews is quick way to see what people are doing, but they do not scale up. If you ever re-configure your website or app, future data projects are going to be hampered by trying to transform pageview contexts into clean, well-defined events. We suggest defining and monitoring critical customer events (e.g., registration, purchasing, onboarding milestones) to get the most out of your analytics.

                            Aggregate statistics provide a "bird's eye view" of your data and are sufficient for broad assessment of marketing channels. Nevertheless, the most fruitful data strategies are going to require access to individual user data — tracing a particular user through time. This is key for developing predictive customer models and optimization.

                            If you have multiple websites, products, or apps, it can often be helpful to track an individual customer across all of your products (even if they are just browsing, logged-out). This opens up the possibility to optimize all of your properties holistically, and not view each in a silo.

                            Transforming your data into KPIs — clear, meaningful metrics that relate to your company's strategic goals — is essential to making data "actionable." Many companies take pride in generating and storing lots of their data, then dumping it on anyone asks. But the best companies from a data science perspective know how to simplify their data into things like KPIs.

                            What's the use of having all these data if you cannot access it? Data science is all about communication. Storing your data in a database behind a lock-and-key, or simply spitting it out into tables is not good communication. A good dashboard will transform the way you monitor and manage your organization.

                            SQL is the language of data science — a universal way for data scientists to access your data. The best dashboards can "scale up" with your company by allowing data scientists to create new visualizations using SQL. That way, when you launch a new feature, you can tailor your data visualizations nearly immediately without adding on new tech overhead or expense.

                            For small companies, sharing one dashboard is often okay. But as you grow, it rapidly becomes clear that different stakeholders need different views into your data, whether it's because they need to make different kinds of decisions or simply have different preferences. In any case, it's important that the data work for everyone, and flexible, customizable dashboards go a long way here.

                            Some very popular tools for "data-driven insights" often hoard your data, offering you only fancy visualizations and summaries. These can be fun and are surely better than nothing at all. But you'll need you direct access to the underlying data if you are going to build models and reap the rewards of integrating machine learning into your organization.

                            Often the most powerful insights come from integrating your data across all of its sources. Integrating data like this is much easier to do when the data are stored together in a common location (e.g., an <a target="_blank" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS S3 bucket or Redshift cluster</a>), rather than spread out across your various service providers. Storing your data together also keeps you from having to worry about what happens if one of your providers closes up shop.

While <a target="_blank" href="is-data-science-only-useful-for-big-data.html">we argue that small datasets are more useful than people often think</a>, there's no denying that more data is better — and you cannot get back what you never stored.

The problem isn't that you simply need to upgrade your storage, but that your entire data pipeline (from product to warehouse to analysis) might need to be modified. Do not let your data strategy create more "technical debt" for your company — build your data pipeline and warehouse on a scaleable, cloud architecture like AWS. We've helped numerous clients deploy and integrate AWS services to meet their organization's needs.

                            Your data should unlock new, actionable insights into your organization and its customers through statistical modeling. Broadly speaking, this means learning <i>what causes what</i>. Depending on your organization, this could mean asking how a user's first day on your app relates to their likelihood of purchasing, how their demographics increase/decrease churn rate, or what marketing techniques lead to optimal conversion. The models that you choose to implement should reflect your priorities; for example, you may begin with a simpler model when you need some quick insights and decisions, while more mature companies will favour more complex models that are offer finer-grained analysis more suited to long-term strategizing. Here at Strong, we are all PhD-trained scientists and experts in using statistical modeling to unearth clear, actionable insights.

                            Before running an experiment, it's critical that you decide how it will be evaluated. Too often we find that organizations test a new strategy or concept with the idea that they want to know if it's "better." The problem with this is that "better" isn't always clear: metrics sometimes do not tell the same story and there are often trade-offs between them. We suggest that our clients pick KPIs of interest before any experimenting. This not only makes experiments easier to interpret, but also keeps experimenters from simple finding the metrics that tell the story they want to be true.

                            Without randomized controls, your experiment simply isn't an experiment; it's just a change that you measured and correlated with some outcome and, as they say, correlation isn't causation.

Not only do you want to know how likely it is that you are right/wrong in accepting a given outcome as truth, you want to know the potential upside and downside (in real dollar costs) of taking a given action based on a decision. Sometimes results that seem strong based on pure metrics are much weaker than they appear, but using appropriate, valid statistical methods (which we can help you with) can mitigate this risk.

                            A typical mistake that we see people (especially talented developers) make is thinking that, because they know how to run an experiment and gather statistics from a technical perspective, that they also know how from a scientific perspective. The truth is that designing and interpreting experiments isn't easy. We've worked with billion-dollar companies that consistently produce biased results with inflated error rates, leading them to making incorrect and costly decisions on a regular basis. If you're going to take the time to run experiments, we suggest that you work with a data science company with scientific training and expertise (like us at Strong Analytics) to ensure that these experiments produce the most valuable and actionable results possible.
